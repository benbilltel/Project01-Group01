# Project01-Group01
E-commerce full-stack web app (React.js + Java Spring Boot + MySQL). In the React app, when working with React lifecycle, I have used Redux to manage states and 
variables from the Spring app. I utilized Axios to handle APIs and React-Bootstrap to handle the UI. On the Spring app side, I have already built it based on the MVC 
model and used Spring Data JPA for CRUD operations with entities.
